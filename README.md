# Skinlytic AI - Skin Disease Detection App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The app uses TensorFlow.js to analyze skin images and detect potential skin diseases such as Eczema, Psoriasis, and Acne.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn (package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skinlytic-ai.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd skinlytic-ai

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

## Running the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Using npm:

npm run dev

After running the command, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action.

**Now you have to simultaneously run the app.py file in the terminal**
Make sure you are in the right directory were the app.py file is there
To do that make sure you have install this :

pip install flask

pip install Pillow

pip install numpy

Now run the app.py file :

python app.py

## Using the App
1. **Upload an Image:**

Click the "Upload Image" button to select a skin image from your device.

2. **Analyze the Image:**

The app will process the image using TensorFlow.js and display the predicted skin disease.

3. **View Results:**

The results will show the most likely skin disease (e.g., Eczema, Psoriasis, or Acne).

## Example Terminal Output
When you run the development server, you should see something like this in your terminal:

> skinlytic-ai@1.0.0 dev
> next dev

  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.0.3
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local
  - Ready in 2.1s

When you run the python file the output looks something like this:

C:\Users\KJCOEMR\Desktop\kk>python app.py
